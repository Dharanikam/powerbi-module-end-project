#  Transport Operations Dashboard – Power BI Project

##  Project Overview

This Power BI project visualizes key performance metrics for a transportation company, focusing on **fuel efficiency**, **delivery performance**, and **operational costs** across various regions and routes. The dashboard provides actionable insights to help management improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance on-time delivery rates.

---

##  Objectives

* Analyze **on-time delivery performance** by region and route.
* Track **fuel efficiency trends** across months.
* Monitor **cost per kilometer** to optimize operational expenses.
* Provide a clear view of **average delivery time** for better decision-making.

##  Key Metrics

| Metric                    | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fuel Efficiency**       | Tracks vehicle fuel efficiency (km/litre) across routes and months.   |
| **On-Time Delivery %**    | Measures the percentage of shipments delivered on or before schedule. |
| **Cost per km**           | Monitors average delivery cost per kilometer.                         |
| **Average Delivery Time** | Evaluates the average time taken for deliveries across all routes.    |
